From the back-cover:<div style="font-weight: bold"></div> Foundations of the Science of Economics<div style="font-weight: normal">begins the process of making Macroeconomics into a Science. Data is analyzed, best Models are selected using a new Information Criterion, Hypotheses are formed and tested on the data…and then predictions are made. To the extent the predictions are verified, Hypotheses become Theories and Economics will finally be a Science. The data analyzed in this way includes Population, Technology, Warfare and events such as epidemics or Climate Change, GDP, Income and others. The Models found are then used to formulate and verify two Laws of Economics. The book includes introductory material on the methods of Science and some mathematical background. Extensive details are presented throughout.</div>
    This data-driven book is not based on models nor on correlation coefficients. A variety of functions are optimized to fit the data, and the best function is selected using a new Information Criterion. These Hypotheses are used to make falsifiable predictions, some of which are already tested. Data analyzed include Population, Technology, GDP, the frequency and severity of Wars and Natural Catastrophes and a variety of others. A number of novel Hypotheses are derived from the models.
