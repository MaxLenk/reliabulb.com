I specialize in Electronics, and in particular Light, LEDs and Analog. I am the author of the best-selling "Practical Design of Power Supplies" and co-author of the best-selling "Practical Lighting Design with LEDs".<br /> My new "Supply-Chain Robust Power Supply Design: Procurable Components, Modern Performance, With Notes for the Hobbyist" will be available in February, 2026. I give a complete guide to making your design ROBUST against SUPPLY-CHAIN issues without compromising performance. <br/> If you can't hire enough engineers or the ones you have are stuck, contact me. I can design it, or if you can't imagine how it could be done, I can invent it.

If you're running up against limits of data availability or in processing speed in Computational Statistics, maybe what you need is not more think-alike PhDs, but rather new ideas about how to build systems. My "ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT COMMUNICATION THROUGH HIERARCHICAL KEYWORD PARSING" is one such. Contact me to discuss achieving your company's next break-through.

I bring new perspectives on traditional problems in applied mathematics.

From the back-cover of my book: "Analytic Functional Equations" brings the systematic method of Formal Power Series to bear on solving a wide variety of Functional Equations, both classical and new, without the traditional guesswork. Also covered are Finite Difference Equations, and how to go from both kinds to Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations. A final chapter deals with a new definition of Functional Derivatives and Functional Differential Equations. Extensive examples are presented throughout.

If you have an interesting idea or a problem that needs solving, please contact me.
