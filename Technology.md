I specialize in Electronics, and in particular Light, LEDs and Analog. I am the author of the best-selling "Practical Design of Power Supplies" and co-author of the best-selling "Practical Lighting Design with LEDs". My new __"Supply-Chain Robust Power Supply Design: Procurable Components, Modern Performance, With Notes for the Hobbyist"__ will be available in February, 2026. If you can't hire enough engineers or the ones you have are stuck, contact me. I can design it, or if you can't imagine how it could be done, I can invent it.
